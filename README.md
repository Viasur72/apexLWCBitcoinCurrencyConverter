# apexSalesforce - LWC Bitcoin Currency Converter
Salesforce Bitcoin Currency Converter LWC

This is a simple bitcoin currency converter LWC that uses a GET HTTP call to https://bitpay.com/api/rates/ to obtain values for each currency. 

All classes are included, even the test classes. Feel free to modified or let me know of modifications that can improve this app. 

converterMockResponse1 and converterMockResponse2 are json responses for the test class. 
They are included on the folder Static Resources in this repository together with other files like the component background.
If you have any issues you can just rename converterMockResponse1 and converterMockResponse2 to .json and after that you can  add them 
to you static resources. 

**IMPORTA NOTE: Make sure you import to the Race Code obejct the data that is on the RateCodeInitialData file!
